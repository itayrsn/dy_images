Take-Home Assignment: Image Search Application

Objective:

Develop an image search application that allows users to search for images based on textual queries. The application will process a dataset of image URLs, by downloading the images, generate embeddings for each image using an image recognition model, index these embeddings in a vector database, and provide a user interface for searching and displaying relevant images.

Tasks:

Image Downloader Service:

Download all images from a provided dataset of image URLs.
Store the downloaded images in a shared volume accessible by other services.

- Embedding Generator Service/Job:
Utilize an image recognition model to create an embedding vector for each image.
You may use pre-trained models available. OpenAI CLIP is a good example of such a model so is BLIP.

- Vector Database Service:
Index the embedding vectors using a vector database or in memory.
You can choose any suitable vector database like Faiss, or Elasticsearch with vector capabilities. Or just create an in memory one with library such as NumPy or Annoy.
Expose an API endpoint to query the database based on embedding similarity.

- User Interface Service:
Create a user interface where users can input a search term (e.g., "men", "playing with a ball" and get relevant images as a result).
Convert the search term into an embedding using the same model.
Query the vector database for similar image embeddings.
Display the retrieved images to the user.
Another option is to create an API that receives a "query_string" and returns the path (or image_url) of the image. (e.g. GET /get_image?query_string=Bathroom HTTP/1.1 returns { "query": "Bathroom","image_url": "http://images.cocodataset.org/train2017/000000324266.jpg" }

- Requirements:
Code should be in python.
You may implement with as many services as needed. Either a service per task or one service (monolith) for all the tasks.
Each service, job, or database should run within its own Docker container.
Use Docker Compose to orchestrate and run all services locally.
Ensure proper communication between services, using networking or shared volumes as needed.
Provide clear documentation and setup instructions.

- Deliverables:
Source code for all services.
A docker-compose.yml file to run all services locally.
Instructions on how to build and run the application.
You should be able to explain how you would scale out the architecture if there are millions of images and high traffic to the the search interface

- Instructions:
Focus on modularity and clear separation of concerns between services.
Ensure that services are resilient and handle errors gracefully.
Write clean, maintainable code with appropriate documentation and comments.
Start with the simple tasks such as downloading the images efficiently, then move on to more complex ones like generating the embeddings.
It is expected to use ChatGPT, Claude or any other LLM for help with the coding of this project.
